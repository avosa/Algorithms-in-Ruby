Write an algorithm in Ruby that receives a string and returns the repeated character (if any) that appears the earliest in the string (or null, if no character is repeated). For example:

first_repeated_character("ABCA") returns A

first_repeated_character("BCABA") returns B

first_repeated_character("glovol") returns l

first_repeated_character("ABC") returns null
