Write an algorithm in Ruby that receives a string and returns the repeated character (if any) that appears the earliest in the string (or null, if no character is repeated). For example:

firstRepeatedCharacter("ABCA") returns A

firstRepeatedCharacter("BCABA") returns B

firstRepeatedCharacter("glovol") returns l

firstRepeatedCharacter("ABC") returns null
