Dominoes is a game played with tiles with two values on it - one on the left, one on the right,
for example [2-4] or [4-5].
Two tiles can be joined together if they contain a common value. The two tiles above can be joined like this: [2-4][4-5]
We'll call a sequence of n joined tiles a chain of length n.
Given a list of dominos as a string in the format [left-right] and each domino separated by comma, write a method to
determine the length of the longest chain that can be formed using these tiles.
examples:
input: "1-1,3-5,5-2,2-3,2-4"
answer: 3

input: "2-5,5-5,3-1,6-7"
answer: 2

input: "1-2,2-3,6-7,8-4,4-3,3-2,2-6"
answer: 4

input: "2-2,5-5,3-1,6-7"
answer: 1
